# Eliseo's Portfolio!

## Hi! thanks for taking the time to look at my portfolio

## Getting Started

Fork or clone repository
cd into the repository and run npm install to install dependencies.
Get the project up and running with npm start.

## The Objective
I wanted to create a portfolio so I have a live site to display my work for any potential employers.
Audio is included but by default is set to mute. You can turn on the audio by pressing the speaker icon in the top right corner of the screen.
The portfolio includes an about, contact, and projects section which can be navigated through using the links
in the header.
